# ReadMe

This GitHub repository is maintained by a novice (and naive) programmer, a buddying coder who has been navigating the digital tapestry for a few moons. The programmer used to be an organic chemist before deciding to switch over to the regime of computational calculations and analysis of chemical entities. This repository contains a couple of folders that harbor scripts, written for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.  
<p>
Scripts include Python and Bash mostly which can streamline workflows of data analysis and automation of tasks on Linux. Each folder contains its own **readme.md** files that may be consulted before looking at the scripts. 
<p>
This repository will be maintained, on a semi-regular basis, as more codes are uploaded. The codes may contain redundant lines of code and should be used warily. The codes would be optimized, if needed, from time to time.
